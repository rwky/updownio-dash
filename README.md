# updown.io dashboard

This is a dashboard for updown.io which allows creating unique urls which query a subset of checks on your account.
It shows the alias or url of a check, the status of the check (UP/DOWN/DISABLED).  
If the check is public then a button to the status page will also be shown.  
Down checks will appear at the top and will show the time when the downtime was detected.  
The dashboard updates every 5 minutes, this can be configured by editing refreshInterval in public/index.html
